#+TITLE: Nicolas Chan
* Introduction
Thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet!
I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley studying computer science and math.
Specifically, I'm interested in computer security and program synthesis.
I currently work part-time as an operations intern at [[https://research-it.berkeley.edu/programs/berkeley-research-computing][Berkeley Research Computing]].
Outside of school and work, I play the clarinet in the [[http://calband.berkeley.edu][Cal Band]] and wind ensemble!
